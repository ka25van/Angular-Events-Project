Necessity of Various Modules
1.CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

Necessity: Allows your server to accept requests from different origins (domains).
Use Case: If your frontend is hosted on a different domain than your backend, CORS is necessary to enable communication between them.
Example: Your Angular frontend hosted on http://localhost:4200 needs to make API calls to your backend hosted on http://localhost:3000.
app.use(cors({
    origin: 'http://localhost:4200'
}));

2.Helmet

Necessity: Helps secure your Express app by setting various HTTP headers.
Use Case: Protects your app from some well-known web vulnerabilities by setting HTTP headers appropriately.
Example: Prevents clickjacking by setting the X-Frame-Options header.

3.Server (HTTP Server)

Necessity: Required to create an HTTP server to handle incoming requests.
Use Case: Allows you to attach your Express app to an HTTP server, enabling it to listen for requests.
Example: const server = require('http').createServer(app); creates an HTTP server that can handle requests.
const server = require('http').createServer(app);
server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});

4.Redis

Necessity: In-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker.
Use Case: Useful for caching, session management, and real-time analytics.
Example: Storing user session data to reduce database load and improve performance.
const redisClient = redis.createClient();
redisClient.set('key', 'value', redis.print);

5.Queue (Bull)

Necessity: A job queue implementation for processing jobs asynchronously.
Use Case: Useful for background processing of tasks like sending emails, processing images, etc.
Example: Adding a job to the queue to send a welcome email to a new user without blocking the main thread.
const jobQueue = new Queue('jobQueue', { redis: { host: '127.0.0.1', port: 6379 } });
jobQueue.add({ email: 'user@example.com' });

6.Request (Supertest)

Necessity: Library for testing HTTP endpoints.
Use Case: Useful for writing tests to ensure your API endpoints are working correctly.
Example: Writing a test to check if the /login endpoint returns a 200 status code.
const request = require('supertest');
request(app)
    .get('/login')
    .expect(200)
    .end((err, res) => {
        if (err) throw err;
    });
